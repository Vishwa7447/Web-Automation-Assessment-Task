# Web-Automation-Assessment-Task
First, set up the framework structure for executing tests in Robot Framework
for that 
1) Install Python
2) Install Robot framework - pip install robotframework
3) Instal Selenium Library - pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
4) Install Chrome Driver Manually or Automatic
5) Create the folder structure :-
   *** Settings ***
Library  SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${URL}  https://www.example.com

*** Test Cases ***
Open Browser to Example
    Open Browser  ${URL}  Chrome

***   Keywords ***
User Defined Keywords

 6) Then run your testcases using command


- Below Command used to run all testcases from the .robot file
C:\Users\91976\Downloads\AutomationTask>robot Task.robot

- Command used to run single testcase from the test suite :-
robot --include TC_01 Downloads/Task.robot

-Pabot Command:- Robot framework aslo support parallel execution at a time in different browsers

7) Used parameterized approach wherever possbile and used validation checks.
8) After execution logs and report files generated by framework

Like this way, a basic automation can be started for any web application. While working on actual project, things will be bit diffeerent due to large code files but the basic framework will be as explained above only.
Dynamic data handling during runtime as well can be handeled with this framework and also robust to integrate with API and UFT related tools using robot framework

Thanks!
